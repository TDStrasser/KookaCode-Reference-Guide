and is intended to demystify the vocabulary often used in association with computers and software.


.. glossary::

    Kookaberry
      The **Kookaberry** is a microcomputer specifically designed for **STEM** educational applications.  
      See https://learn.auststem.com.au/exploring-the-kookaberry/

    KookaBlocs
      **KookaBlocs** is a visual code editor based on Google Blockly and is designed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA).
      **KookaBlocs** incorporates Google Blockly, an open-source developer library created by Google that provides a visual programming interface which 
      enables users to create programs by dragging and dropping interlocking, graphical blocks that represent code concepts.
      **KookaBlocs** is intended to be run on hardware using the Kooka Firmware such as a **Kookaberry** from Kookaberry Pty Ltd and Pico, 
      Pico 2 modules from Raspberry Pi.  Key characteristics of **KookaBlocs** include **Visual Programming** using a drag-and-drop interface with 
      puzzle-piece-like blocks, eliminating the need for users to write code line by line or worry about syntax.
      **KookaBlocs** can be launched using https://auststem.com.au/KookaBlocs/ 
      
    KookaCode
      **KookaCode** is a **MicroPython** scripting code editor and is designed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA). 
      **KookaCode** is intended to be run on hardware using the Kooka Firmware such as a **Kookaberry** from Kookaberry Pty Ltd 
      and Pico, Pico 2 modules from Raspberry Pi.
      **KookaCode** can be launched using https://auststem.com.au/KookaCode/

    KookaSuite (now deprecated)
      A suite of programming tools for the **Kookaberry** comprising **KookaBlockly** visual coding tool,
      **KookaIDE** a **MicroPython** integrated development tool, and **KookaTW** a tool for mirroring / virtualising the **Kookaberry**'s 
      display and buttons. Please note that **KookaSuite** has now been deprecated and will no longer be developed.
      KookaSuite has been replaced by **KookaBlocs** and **KookaCode**.
    
    Progressive Web Application (PWA)
      A PWA is a website that works and feels like a native mobile or desktop app, without needing to be downloaded from an app store.
      **KookaBlocs** and **KookaCode** are PWAs.
      Instead of opening **KookaBlocs** in a browser tab every time, you can install it once from the website. 
      It then appears on your home screen, taskbar, or app menu—just like a regular app.
      PWAs will work offline. They can cache content so they continue to work even if your internet connection drops or is slow. 
      When you go back online, they synchronise any changes.
      The developer can update a PWA instantly on their server, and everyone gets the latest version automatically. 
      By refreshing the browser while online, the latest updates will be automatically downloaded.
      See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app.


    Visual Programming
      Using a visual code editor (such as **KookaBlocs**) allows users to work with code visually but still involves actual code blocks or snippets. 
      It might use drag-and-drop interfaces, code blocks, or other visual elements to assist in code creation.
      Visual code editors often aim to make coding more accessible to beginners or those who are not familiar with traditional text-based coding environments.
      It differs from a graphical code editor that may involve more abstract graphical representations of code structures, while
      visual code editors usually retain a connection to the actual code, using visual elements to enhance the coding experience.

    OLED
      Organic Light Emitting Diode - the lighting technology that is used in the **Kookaberry**'s display - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED

    LED
      Light Emitting Diode - a semiconductor that emits a specific wavelength of light when energised.  
      The **Kookaberry** has three LEDs on the front under the display. They emit red, yellow and green light.
      There are two further LEDs on the back: a green LED indicating the **Kookaberry** has power, 
      and a blue LED which indicates file writing activity, or if pulsing slowly indicates the **Kookaberry**'s power supply voltage is low.
      See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode

    MicroPython
      A variant of the computer programming language **Python** developed for use on micro-computers.  
      The **Kookaberry** is programmed using **MicroPython** and has a built-in compiler accessible through editors such as **KookaCode**, 
      **KookaIDE** and **Thonny**.
      **KookaBlocs**, and its predecessor **KookaBlockly**, automatically generate **MicroPython** code when the user assembles a script 
      from visual blocks.
